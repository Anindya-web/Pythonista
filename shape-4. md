**Shapes Identifier**

This Python program determines the type of quadrilateral (four-sided shape) based on the lengths of its sides.

**Functionality:**

1. **Input:** The program prompts the user to enter the lengths of all four sides (slen1, slen2, slen3, slen4).
2. **Validation (Implicit):** While not explicitly coded, it's assumed that the user enters valid numerical values (floats).
3. **Shape Recognition:**
   - **Square:** If opposite sides are equal (slen1 == slen3 and slen2 == slen4) and all sides are equal (slen1 == slen2 == slen3 == slen4), the program identifies it as a square.
   - **Rectangle:** If opposite sides are equal but not all sides are equal, the program identifies it as a rectangle.
   
**How to Use:**

1. Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `shapes.py`).
2. Run the program from your terminal: `python shapes.py`
3. Follow the prompts to enter the side lengths.
4. The program will display the identified shape ("It's a square." or "It's a rectangle.").

**Example Usage:**

```
enter the side length 1: 5
enter the side length 2: 5
enter the side length 3: 5
enter the side length 4: 5
It's a square.

(Run again with different side lengths to see the rectangle output.)
```
